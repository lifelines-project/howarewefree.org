excerpt: >
  "I imagine myself wondering if I would go to a poetry jam, go hiking, or take classes learning the fox trot. In other words, freedom to me is choices and options with real opportunities to obtain those choices and optionsâ€¦ Where there is no right to choose nor chance to advance then freedom cannot exist, whether it be in a relationship, neighborhood, prison or society."
