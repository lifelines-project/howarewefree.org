**ALMA:** Nkechi is a beautiful writer and his words gave me a lot to work with. Art of all kinds, to me, is about communicating some idea, emotion or experience between people, and Nkechi and I communicated well. With this project, it felt important for my work to visually communicate what he was saying in written and spoken word. People listen in different ways – what words won't say to one person a picture might – and I felt this collaboration did a good job of creating unified works. 

**NKECHI:** Concerning the collaboration process that me and Alma developed, it was kind of like an easy game of Connect 4 where we were playing against a blank canvas. Alma would send me a sketch of her overall thought of my words, symbolically dropping a chip in the slot. I would drop my chip, worth an idea. Alma would drop another chip, then another. Then, CONNECT 4!!! The piece was done.

**ALMA:** To me, freedom means choice. Choice is the most powerful thing we can have – we are born with certain choices available to us, and our choices can lead to further choice or restrictions. There are many institutional structures put in place to limit our choices for us. Often as we grow up, we struggle to see which choices are always ours, which we feel ok negotiating on and to what end, and which choices have been taken away that must be taken back. 

**NKECHI:** Freedom to me is the ability of one to make and carry out choice without manipulation, persuasion, influence or force from any outside entity. As it relates to criminal justice, freedom would look like officials, such as judges, being absent of lobbyists, politicians, and distorted public influence that contradicts righteousness and rightness. Freedom would look like District Attorneys devoid of pressure to use deviant tactics, like stockpiling charges for maximum sentencing, in order to reach job performance quotas. Freedom in the league of criminal justice would allow Public Defenders to perform adequately, without force of settlements/plea deals due to restriction of resources and overwhelming caseloads. Freedom would look like a public that is able to resolve legal matters without being subject to inherent bias, prejudices or preferred treatment. All in all, freedom is a space where human beings are allowed to experience an unlimited amount of empathy for one another, and able to act on that empathy without bother.
