    "Imagine existing in a world full of people who dislike, may even hate you because you represent something they refuse to comprehend - like the difference in cultural disposition, political views, etc. Imagine that these people who dislike you control vital resources like toilet paper, mail, food, when the heat will come or go off, and other services."
