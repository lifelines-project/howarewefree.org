I guess if I had to say what freedom meant for me right now, it would not being forgotten by those who have come into my life. Freedom would be the fight that is continuously being done on my behalf to reconnect with those who love and care about me and my welfare. The hardest thing for me to do with collaboration with Robin with the project was absolutely nothing! We were like soulmates when it came down to her and I imagining what this project would look like. The most important thing I come away with from this project is a beautiful candid friendship with a young spirit. I thank my GOD in Heaven for all of you!
