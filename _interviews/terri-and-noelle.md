collaborators: terri and noelle

---

**TERRI:** From this process, I learned that there are some very interesting tools one can use to convey their vision to others. I also picked up on the possibility that everyone has a creative side that can help them clearly allow others into their “personal space.”

I wanted to make clear that freedom looks like change, emotionally, physically, and socially. 

**NOELLE:** Things that I do every day with other collaborators like sending pictures by text or getting an immediate response was a learning curve.  While I believe I am a quick adapter, I found that I was challenged by small adaptations which gave me something to consider and made my communication less frequent. I believe the hardest thing to convey was my initial idea of wanting to historicize her story. It made me step back and look at my goals. Are my goals to truly work with someone or impose my ideas around the work I do? For me what was important as I came to learn more about the process was truthfully engaging her story.

**TERRI:** We are free the moment we accept full responsibility for every choice we’ve made and every outcome or consequence we’ve lived through. We are free when we put in the effort to be honest, compassionate, and of service to those (or just ONE) who need our help. We are free when we breathe. As for what freedom means to me… Freedom means I have an opportunity and an obligation to DO BETTER and BE BETTER. “BETTER” is thinking with forward/long reaching goals to reach out to people who are walking in the shoes I’ve discarded and lay an informational foundation to get them thinking differently about living, friendship, fun, love, and a future.  

**NOELLE:** Freedom to me is autonomy. It is the ability to make decisions for oneself and to direct how one lives and interacts with others in this world. It is to be acknowledged as “fully human” – which for African American women in the United States has been both a legal, social and political struggle against dehumanization processes.
