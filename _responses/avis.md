Describe the collaboration process that you and your partner developed.

Our collaboration process was open dialog that was very descriptive.
 
What was the hardest to convey to your collaborator?

The emotion behind my words.
 
What was particularly important to you to make sure was included?

Aging and the passage of time.
 
What did you learn from the process?

I learned that there are different ways to tell a story. I have a story to tell and Gb Kim is able to help me tell it.
 
What were you surprised by?

I'm surprised that when I thought my life was stagnated at a standstill I was in reality still moving forward, evolving, and growing.
 
What does freedom mean to you?

Freedom means the right to make choices; choices that are healthy for me and ones whose ripple-effect is healthy for those around me.
 
If we were to do a similar project in the future what should we do differently? Is there particular support or information you didn't have that you would have benefitted from? What else could the project have looked like?
I feel that the project was well thought out and well put together.
