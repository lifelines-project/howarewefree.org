The collaborative process with Ms. Williams was exciting. We started with a little get-to-know-you email. THen she suggested I do “I am from…” a poem template that gave her more insight on my daily visualization. I then explained what freedom would look like to me. I did so without thinking, as I felt it’d be the clearest picture. She made it a smooth process for me, especially since I’m not an artist or overly creative. I wanted to make clear that freedom looks like change, emotionally, physically, and socially. 

From this process, I learned that there are some very interesting tools one can use to convey their vision to others. I also picked up on the possibility that everyone has a creative side that can help them clearly allow others into their “personal space.” I was surprised that I didn’t give Ms. Williams a difficult crossed info or mixed up visions.

My correspondence with Ms. Williams netted some interesting thoughts and views on artists and how seriously they plan out their work, but I wouldn’t share what she said to me without her permission.

I’d first like to answer the question that is the title of the exhibit: “We are free the moment we accept full responsibility for every choice we’ve made and every outcome or consequence we’ve lived through. We are free when we put in the effort to be honest, compassionate, and of service to those (or just ONE) who need our help. We are free when we breathe.” As for what freedom means to me… Freedom means I have an opportunity and an obligation to DO BETTER and BE BETTER. “BETTER” is thinking with forward/long reaching goals to reach out to people who are walking in the shoes I’ve discarded and lay an informational foundation to get them thinking differently about living, friendship, fun, love, and a future. 

If you do a similar project in the future, the only thing you could do differently that’d enhance the outcome would be to ask more in-depth questions into participants’ core issues/background. Why? Because often the broader questions provoke superficial answers, and that doesn’t pull in potential supporters. It wasn’t that you didn’t provide support and/or information that was beneficial. It was a totally new project that opened me up to sharing myself without any expectations, and that was uplifting. The support thereafter was a blessing! My hope is that the process looks like newness, making a difference on a major level and looks like a project that goes from grassroots to national exposure.
