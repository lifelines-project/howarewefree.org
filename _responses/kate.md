Describe the collaboration process that you and your partner developed. What was the hardest to convey to your collaborator? What was particularly important to you to make sure was included?

We started by a few quick emails, then had a great phone conversation mostly about RJ. I was overwhelmed by the strength of Phil's writing. I wanted to be sure to make something that was as powerful as his writing and so it took me a while to come up with how to move forward. Honestly, it was a very easy collaboration... once the ideas came, the titles of our emails became things like "more ideas, now we're flowing." To me I wanted to make sure that Phil really felt like he saw his input in the work, that it was directly informed by his experiences & that we used his personal insight to speak to the experiences of many people. 
 
What did you learn from this process? What were you surprised by?

I've never worked with anyone in prison who has access to email, this drastically improved our communication & ability to move forward with ideas. Phil's energy & ideas were really generative for my creative process. I think at first I felt like it was my job to invent the art but once I re-engaged with him, our conversations were super generative and we thought of like 5 projects we want to complete.

Are there any excerpts from your correspondence together that you found particularly powerful that you’d be willing to share with us?

Our working title for the exhibit is “How are we free?” The title is meant to evoke both the question of how we free ourselves/our loved ones from prison, but also to invite a deeper inquiry into what freedom means, what it feels like, and how we as a society are falling short on creating the conditions for liberation (all themes we saw heavily reflected both in the writing of LifeLines members and in the artwork produced). Our question for you is: What does freedom mean to you?

To me freedom exists when we are able to achieve our full selves accessing our full humanity, creativity & capacity to thrive in relationships that are both loving and challenging. A part of this includes defending this freedom for others & discovering fulfillment by experiencing the liberation of others. 

If we were to do a similar project in the future, what should we do differently? 

I think if the themes were a bit more specific, it might stimulate deeper conversations right off the bat & also support people to be more creative. Limitations often serve to inspire out of the box thinking on things like this. 

Is there particular support or information you didn’t have that you would have benefited from? What else could the process have looked like?

3 pieces of art is a lot & with such a small stipend, it's really hard to carve out time to do the work. Extending the deadlines helped a ton. The basics of being paired with Phil, receiving his writing & then talking & corresponding with email was super great! I loved being matched with a person & inventing how to work as a team.
