**PHILL:** I learned that art is a highly effective way to tell a story about unspeakable issues, such as how a man who’s been locked up for 22 years answers questions about his inability to leave a visiting room to his 7-year-old nephew. 

**KATE:** I feel like you’ve captured something that’s a key feature in the prison experience: that the most human basic needs become reformatted into a series of protocols that insult your humanity every step of the way, right? Food, clothing, shelter, hygiene, water… we could make art for the next 10 years about how these basics are used to remind [incarcerated people] of their powerlessness and lack of agency.

**PHILL:** Freedom to me is the ability to make choices about where my body will be on a given day and who I will share space with. This definition comes directly out of conversations between me and Kate. There are also freedoms of the non-physical variety that prison walls can’t confine. 

**KATE:** To me freedom exists when we are able to achieve our full selves accessing our full humanity, creativity & capacity to thrive in relationships that are both loving and challenging. A part of this includes defending this freedom for others & discovering fulfillment by experiencing the liberation of others.
