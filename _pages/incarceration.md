excerpt: "Visualize an image from your daily life or the prison landscape that you want the public to see. Describe that image in as much detail as you can. [Note: This might be something that you think the public fails to consider, or simply isnâ€™t aware of; it could be something that is vividly representative of your daily experience or gives picture to a moment of unusual punctuation; it could be something hidden or forgotten, or something that is alternately all too common; it could be a specific moment of joy and agency in the face of constraint or a vivid window into everyday difficulty. Most importantly it is an image that you think the public needs to see]"
