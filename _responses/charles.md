Describe the collaboration process that you and your partner developed. What was the hardest to convey to your collaborator? What was particularly important to you to make sure was included?
 
The process of communicating with my partner was at times daunting. We had three channels of communication. Each came with its share of challenges. For instance communicating via snail mail took forever but was the only means available that offered some privacy. Both the phone and electronic email systems offered no safeguard for our social capital. Both are very risky forms of communicating ideas, particularly those that might be sensitive. It was often frustrating trying to strike a balance between what was okay to share and what wasn't through these mediums.
 
It is very difficult to convey to someone who hasn't been incarcerated what the actual experience is like and it is damn near impossible to articulate what it is to be serving/fighting a dbi sentence. Sure, I can give you an idea but even looking for words and images to capture the essence of what it is like, is complicated. It was easier for me to expound on some of the issues that surround dbi. For instance the hour glass, we use to illustrate the urgency and dire need for community awareness and engagement in issues revolving around the need to ban the practice of dbi sentences. Another would be the suffocating effect that dbi has on its inhabitants. Instead of painting a flowery image for you, it was important that my partner, "Keebs" and I rendered a disturbing image. If it frustrates, angers, shocks, annoys, agitates or confuses, it has served in part its purpose.
 
What did you learn from this process? What were you surprised by?
 
It was really easy to work with Keebs barring the limitations we had to navigate in order to communicate. I learned that our core humanity transcends age, gender identification and/or association, race, class and geography.
 
Are there any excepts from your correspondence together that you found particularly powerful that you'd be willing to share with us?
 
 
Our working title/or the exhibit is "How are we free?" The title is meant to evoke both the
question of how we free ourselves/our loved ones from prison, but also to invite a deeper inquiry into what freedom means, what it feels like, and how we as a society are falling short on creating the conditions for liberation (all themes we say heavily reflected both in the writing of LifeLines members and in the artwork produced). Our question for you is: What does freedom mean to you?
 
It is definitely not an abstract concept. The problem with defining freedom is that it is subjective. The complexity evolving around an individualized characterization is that it's bias and therefore disallows others. Freedom is being able to love without the fear of the repercussions. I just love you and fight for you because I realize that my existence is intertwined with yours and vice-versa. Freedom is to have a stake in the issues that affect you. No means no and if I don't want your unwarranted advances or your corporations drilling for oil on my property then stay the f**k off. If it's mine, then it's sacred. Freedom means me as a human being having more rights that a corporation. When the people cry out for justice, freedom and equality and it does not land on a deaf ear... that's freedom. When the people cry out that's too much... whether it be misogyny, discrimination, racism, mass incarceration, xenophobia, etc. and it stops, then that's freedom.
 

RESPONSES TO INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Freedom means being free from the very need to be free.

What do genuine justice and healing look like to you?
 
Genuine justice and healing look like a community that includes oppose to permanently ostracizing its members when they have violated the social norms. To punish for the sake of punishing in _ hopes that it will somehow deter further violations is ludicrous. When we result primarily to a knee jerk reaction of inflicting pain on those who have caused pain, all we do is add to the suffering that is already too prevalent in most societies. What purpose does it serve to send a message that violators will be forced to regret their offenses for as long as they breathe?  What will threats_of nuking or blasting someone off the planet serve? If those threats were acted upon, how would it contribute to unadulterated justice and healing?  There may come a time when a person's behavior is so irrational that it may warrant banishing him/her from the community; however, whenever a person is ostracize from a community, the ultimate goal should be to find ways to incorporate them back into the community at an agreed upon period of time. When a member is shunned from the community, the community suffers right along with that person. Genuine justice and healing seeks atonement, redemption and when possible reconciliation. It's about accountability, paying-itÂ­ forward and at the end of the day, it's also about inclusion. While the member(s) who caused harm is shunned to give him or her time to consider the magnitu1e of the harm caused; time to empathize with the person/people who were harined and to seek out ways to be a contributing member (making amends); the community itself, must also wrestle with how to bring that person back into the fold. While it shames the behavior and the thinking that led to the offense (s), it makes every attempt on the other hand to save the person; thus, bringing about true justice and healing.
 
How does the vision that you've just described differ from the current criminal justice system?
 
The current criminal legal system is based on just desserts. It calls for an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It doesn't seek to heal and its interpretation of justice is largely based on dehumanizing, ostracizing, and inflicting more harm on those who have harmed. If everyone who harmed someone had to give up an eye or a tooth for their violations, then the whole world would consist of blind and toothless people.
 
I want justice and healing to begin with me. It begins with me being more just in my everyday interactions with others. Instead of focusing entirely on the criminal legal system and where it fall short (its imperfections), I would rather mull over what role (s) I am having in creating either a more just or unjust world. The more just I become the more healing and harmony I will spawn in this world. One of my greatest passions nowadays is, as Ghandi said, "to be (being) the change I want .to see in the world''. This is what fuels, ignites, inspires and invigorates me when I wake up in the morning.
 
I want substance use disorder to end with me. I became heavily involved with drugs early on in life. Many of my dreams were never realized because of my overindulgence with drugs. I could honestly say that I would not be incarcerated today, had I been strong enough to withstand the temptation and peer-pressure that led me head-on into a drug induced culture. Substance use disorder will end with me not only by my not indulging but by me also resurrecting a program I created here in the nineties to educate others about the harmful effects of substance use disorders.
