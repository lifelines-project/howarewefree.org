Describe the collaboration process that you and your partner developed. What was the hardest to convey to your collaborator? What was particularly important to you to make sure was included?

I learned a lot from the collaboration process.  I had hoped our collaboration would be more intimate – but hadn’t considered the limited communication opportunities.  Things that I do every day with other collaborators like sending pictures by text or getting an immediate response was a learning curve.  While I believe I am a quick adapter, I found that I was challenged by small adaptations which gave me something to consider and made my communication less frequent.

I believe the hardest thing to convey was my initial idea of wanting to historicize her story.  It made me step back and look at my goals.  Are my goals to truly work with someone or impose my ideas around the work I do? 
For me what was important as I came to learn more about the process was truthfully engaging her story.  I would often read it over and over again and highlight the key themes.

It was also important for me to use an image of her that conveyed who I met in the email.  That took a little time to track down but was worth it in the end.
 
What did you learn from this process? What were you surprised by?
I learned more about communication and the prison system.  But most importantly I learned how our value and cultural systems as African American women do not get left at the gate when entering a prison.  We carry who we are with us.
 
Are there any excerpts from your correspondence together that you found particularly powerful that you’d be willing to share with us?

I am from
By Terri-Joell Harper

I am from underwear, from All and Taster's Choice.
I am from the duplicated row houses in North.
I am from the spider, the Wandering Jew climbing the walls.
I am from Sunday dinners and thick hips, from Nana and Ms. Ellie.
I am from the 12 plus 1 and unity rarely challenged.
From chocolate will give you worms if you eat it in Summer and you must graduate from high school, if you don't do anything else.
I am from Islam, even while making my rounds with the Baptists at Wayland Temple on Columbia Avenue (Cecil B. Moore).now I feel at peace. I'm from Pennsylvania Hospital fitting for a Philly girl eating pancakes bopping to the oldies. From the slavery days of 1889, looking White but seen all Black, Nana blazed the trail up North to get me to today, the New Slavery...........
that Jae became victim to, called Crack, almost destroyed the Sisters and Ms T, who swooped in hoping to save the family from in fighting.
I am from Master Street, Slocum Street and Summer trips to North Carolina, but the 7 years on Bradford Drive rank at the top as times where a little Black girl surrounded by privileged Whites honed her cooking, social and shopping skills and saw a singly attached Black mother hold her own against a cowardly man, prejudice, and the IRS.
 
Our working title for the exhibit is “How are we free?” The title is meant to evoke both the question of how we free ourselves/our loved ones from prison, but also to invite a deeper inquiry into what freedom means, what it feels like, and how we as a society are falling short on creating the conditions for liberation (all themes we saw heavily reflected both in the writing of LifeLines members and in the artwork produced). Our question for you is: What does freedom mean to you?

Freedom to me is autonomy.  It is the ability to make decisions for oneself and to direct how one lives and interacts with others in this world.  It is to be acknowledged as “fully human” – which for African American women in the United States has been both a legal, social and political struggle against dehumanization processes.
 
Finally, while your answers to the above questions may appear in LifeLines materials, this last question is just for our own internal use and learning. If we were to do a similar project in the future, what should we do differently? Is there particular support or information you didn’t have that you would have benefited from? What else could the process have looked like?
