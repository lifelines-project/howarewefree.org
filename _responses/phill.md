The collaborative process was/is seamless because Kate is awesome and we have similar thoughts on what's broken about the criminal legal system and the dire need to imagine and work toward something different. I believe her work inside various places of confinement helped us jump past an orientation on prisons and prison issues and right to the creative process. 

I didn’t really go into the process thinking (consciously anyway) that anything in particular was important or necessary to include. Kate pointed out that in both my visualizing incarceration and freedom pieces, the theme of family and loved ones is present. As a result of our conversations, the impact of incarceration on families ended up front and center in our art. And I love that!

I learned that art is a highly effective way to tell a story about unspeakable issues, such as how a man who’s been locked up for 22 years answers questions about his inability to leave a visit room to his 7-year-old nephew. 

What surprised me most is the final product (well the description of it because I’ve yet to see it). I guess I expected a painting since that’s the typical form of art I’m most familiar with. But art is SO vast and limitless. The greeting card idea -- and others we ended up not using (at least not yet) really blew me away. 

Excerpts:

(from Kate to me)

“My experience working in prisons, I feel like you’ve captured something that’s a key feature in the prison experience: that the most human basic needs become reformatted into a series of protocols that insult your humanity every step of the way, right? Food, clothing, shelter, hygiene, water… we could make art for the next 10 years about how these basics are used to remind [incarcerated people] of their powerlessness and lack of agency.”

“In all your writings there is this idea that ‘your freedom’ or the freedom of any [incarcerated person] is linked to other people. It’s your physical body, but our freedom is spending our lives where and with who we want; so a piece of the freedom of all the people you love is taken by incarceration when you can’t be with them. Do you think it’d be interesting to explore how your sentence also robs the people in your life of some of their freedom? Personally, I think this concept is strong because it emphasizes how everyone in our society is robbed when incarceration is our primary tool for punishment and when so many people are locked up indefinitely.”

Okay, here’s the deal -- there are too many good quotes and my hand will fall off if I keep writing! I can’t do anything with my emails but read them on my tablet. I can’t even copy and paste. I’m going to ask Kate to print the entire exchange an. It’s about 20 total, half me just us checking in and nothing substantive. You can pick your own quotes. :) Sound good?

Freedom to me is the ability to make choices about where my body will be on a given day and who I will share space with. This definition comes directly out of conversations between me and Kate. There are also freedoms of the non-physical variety that prison walls can’t confine. But for the purpose of this answer, I’ll stick to physical freedom.  

I don’t know that I’d do anything different in the process. It was unrestricted and organic, which sometimes concerns me a little at first when I could use some structure. But I’m glad it was. Once the pairings were made, the collaboration process was ours to decide and that worked out well for me (and I’m guessing Kate too). THere was a point when I thought we weren’t communicating enough because a long period of silence had gone by, but now after reading our emails I can see that we exchanged plenty in those little 2000-character writings. 

Lastly, I don’t know about “How are we free” for the title. It’s cool but doesn’t grab me. Let me keep thinking about it.
