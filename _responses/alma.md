To me, freedom means choice.  Choice is the most powerful thing we can have - we are born with certain choices available to us, and our choices can lead to further choice or restrictions.  There are many institutional structures put in place to limit our choices for us.  Often as we grow up, we struggle to see which choices are always ours, which we feel ok negotiating on and to what end, which choices have been taken away that must be taken back.  To me, freedom is the ability to choose.
