excerpt: >
  "When I look in the faces around me, many of which I've watched for 37 years...I am awed by the beauty that the passing of time has gently carved into them; a crease here, a fold there, gray, silver and white hair, baby-blue rings encircling deep-brown-black pupils which continue to glimmer through their opaqueness."
