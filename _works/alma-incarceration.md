excerpt: >
  "I began to see prison thru the eyes of the usually white, patriotic, blue collar corrections officer who is starting his shift. As I enter the facility, thru these eyes, I refuse to see a community of individuals who may be grandfathers, fathers, sons, brothers or husbands. â€¦ as I head to my assigned post, I see a place that can only be a battlefield full of adversaries."
