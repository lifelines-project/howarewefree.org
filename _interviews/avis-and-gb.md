**AVIS:** I'm surprised that when I thought my life was stagnated at a standstill I was in reality still moving forward, evolving, and growing… 

Gb: There is difficulty in the sense that how can I represent/translate/inscribe/reinscribe another human being without actually being near her – not being able to hear her voice or see the mannerisms of her personality and humanity. I think the most important thing I wanted to impart on the work was a sense of her whimsy and the saturation in her visions of not only the future but her "here and now."

**AVIS:** When I look in the faces around me, many of which I've watched for 37 years...I am awed by the beauty that the passing of time has gently carved into them; a crease here, a fold there, gray, silver and white hair, baby-blue rings encircling deep-brown-black pupils which continue to glimmer through their opaqueness.

I see poets, artists, musicians, crafts workers, mothers, daughters, sisters, nieces, aunts, grandmothers godmothers, wives, and neighbors...I see society. A society of women who live within a society of men, women, and children who are separated from them with barbed-wire fencing, time, and space. I see lives that were thrown away; lives that were stolen, lives that were traded, and lives that were sacrificed for others.

Gb: Freedom is sometimes political, like some type of currency of privilege that mutates based on the type and manner of privilege(s). Freedom is sometimes about "normative" – doing like the casualness of a conversation around "I like the grocery store down the block better than the one on the corner." Freedom is sometimes emotional and is shaped or held by fear – that freedom might be to live free of fear. Freedom is sometimes an awesome chaos like light or the seeming anarchy of particle physics (though of course we could say these are "governed" by mathematics)...freedom is deeply about the ability to employ the mind and all that it contains some way and any way into the physical world.
